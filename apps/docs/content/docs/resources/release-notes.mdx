## February 24, 2026

**Features**

- In [early access](/docs/resources/early-access-features):
  - **Linear Integration**: Create Terragon tasks directly from Linear issue comments by mentioning `@Terragon`. Terragon fetches the issue context, detects linked GitHub repositories, and spins up a sandbox automatically. Link your Linear account and configure defaults in [Settings](https://www.terragonlabs.com/settings/integrations). Check out the [Linear integration guide](/docs/integrations/linear-integration) for setup instructions.

## November 24, 2025

**Features**

- **GPT-5.1-Codex-Max**: You can now use GPT-5.1-Codex-Max with the Codex agent.
- **Claude Opus 4.5**: You can now use Claude Opus 4.5 with the Claude Code agent.
- **Gemini Agent & Gemini 3 Pro**: You can now use Gemini 3 Pro with the Gemini agent in [early access](/docs/resources/early-access-features).
  - Gemini 3 Pro is Google's most advanced reasoning Gemini model. We think this model is great at frontend development and we're excited for you to try it out.

**Out of [early access](/docs/resources/early-access-features)**:

- **Git diff viewer and file tree**: View diffs in a responsive secondary panel inside of tasks.
- **Dynamic model selection with GitHub mentions**: When mentioning @terragon-labs in GitHub issues or PRs, you can now specify which model to use for the task by including it in brackets, e.g., `@terragon-labs [model-name] your request here`. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/github-integration#model-selection).

**UX Improvements & Bug Fixes**

- Various bug fixes for Task forking.
- Fixed a bug where Codex compaction would brick the task.
- Improved error handling for invalid credentials (Eg. Using Opus on Claude Pro, Using GPT-5.1-Codex-Max for non-ChatGPT subscribers).

## November 17, 2025

**Features**

- **GPT-5.1**: GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.1 Codex models are now supported.
  - You can still access the older GPT-5 models by enabling them in [Settings](https://www.terragonlabs.com/settings/agent).
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: The OpenCode agent now supports Gemini 2.5 Pro. Enable this model in [Settings](https://www.terragonlabs.com/settings/agent) to use it.
- **Connect multiple credentials for the same agent**: You can now connect multiple API keys or subscriptions for each agent provider, allowing you to easily switch between them. Each connected credential is distinguished by the email associated with it.

![Multiple credentials](https://cdn.terragonlabs.com/multiple-credentials-1zLJ.png)

**In [early access](/docs/resources/early-access-features):**

- **Branch creation toggle**: When creating a task, you can now decide whether to create a new branch for the task, or simply work on the existing branch. Access this from below all prompt boxes.

![Branch control](https://cdn.terragonlabs.com/branch-toggle-vTKc.png)

- **Task forking**: You can now fork a task by hovering over the last agent message and selecting the fork icon. When a task is forked, the original task's context is summarized and included as context for the new task.
  - Forking a task is helpful if you want to explore multiple directions for a task in parallel, collaborate with multiple agents on different parts of a task (e.g., use GPT-5 to plan and Sonnet to implement, or Haiku to implement and GPT-5 to review, etc.), or if you just want to keep working after a task runs into an error.
  - Tasks that were created from a fork will display a "Forked from …" banner with a deep link back to the original task.

![Task forking](https://cdn.terragonlabs.com/fork-task-yW3l.png)

- **Dynamic model selection with GitHub mentions**: When mentioning @terragon-labs in GitHub issues or PRs, you can now specify which model to use for the task by including it in brackets, e.g., `@terragon-labs [model-name] your request here`. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/github-integration#model-selection).

**UX Improvements & Bug Fixes**

- Reliability improvements for Codex and Claude Code credentials handling.
- Bug fix for handling git diffs of file paths with spaces in them.
- Tweaked the sorting of tasks in the sidebar so they don't jump around as much if they are all "working".

## November 7, 2025

**Features**

- **Global environment variables**: You can now configure environment variables that apply to all of your connected repositories. Follow the updated [environment variables guide](/docs/configuration/environment-setup/environment-variables) to understand precedence and overrides.
- **Credit top-ups**: You can now purchase AI credits to use for tasks. Credits are used when you don't have a provider account linked (eg. ChatGPT, Claude Subscription). These are useful if you want to try out different agents or continue working when you hit a rate limit with your linked provider.
  - All users also now have $10 of free AI credits to use across any new or existing models and agents. Learn more about credit top-ups in the [billing guide](/docs/resources/billing).
  - Credits are sold at cost with no markup or fees so you pay exactly what the underlying AI provider charges.
- **OpenCode Agent**: You can now use OpenCode as an agent with the following supported models: GLM 4.6, Kimi K2, Grok Code Fast 1, Qwen3 Coder 480B. These models provide a good balance between speed, quality and price, making them a great option for quick tasks or when you run into rate limits with other agents.
  - A positive credit balance is required to use the OpenCode agent.
- **Configure available agents and models**: You can now configure which available agents and models show up in the model selector in prompt boxes.

  ![Agent settings](https://cdn.terragonlabs.com/agent_settings-cCI5.png)

- **New features in [early access](/docs/resources/early-access-features)**:

  - **Git diff viewer and file tree**: View diffs in a responsive secondary panel inside of tasks.

    ![Diff viewer](https://cdn.terragonlabs.com/diff_viewer-gH9X.png)

**UX Improvements & Bug Fixes**

- Draft tasks can now be scheduled when submitted.

- Added pagination to the task list to improve performance with large task lists

## October 29, 2025

**Features**

- **GitHub Mention Automation**: Customize the behavior when @terragon-labs is mentioned in GitHub by creating a "GitHub Mention" automation.
  - Pro users can additionally have the automation trigger in response to mentions from bot users.
- **Schedule Multi-Hour Automations**: Pro users can now schedule automations that run at multiple hours on a given day. When creating an automation with a "Schedule" trigger, you can configure it to run at at 9am and 5pm, for example, instead of just once each day.
- **Codex Rate Limit Queueing**: When you hit a rate limit associated with your ChatGPT subscription, Terragon automatically queues new tasks and messages until your rate limit resets. This behavior is similar to how we handle Claude rate limit errors and should help make it easier to continue working when you hit a rate limit.

![Multi-Hour Schedule Automations](https://cdn.terragonlabs.com/multi-hour-schedule-8b3S.png)

**Out of [early access](/docs/resources/early-access-features)**:

**UX Improvements & Bug Fixes**

- Tasks created from automations are now titled with the name of the automation for consistency and ease of scanning the task list.
- Sandbox script timeout errors are now reported even if the sandbox becomes unresponsive. Previously, tasks could hang indefinitely.
- Attachments and images are now persisted in the browser's local storage so they are not lost if you refresh the page.
- The task list is now collapsible when vieiwng a task. This should help reduce clutter and improve focus when viewing a task on smaller screens.
- Quickly duplicate an existing automation by clicking on the "Duplicate" button on the automations page.
- Easily toggle between Light and Dark mode from the sidebar. Accessible by clicking on your user avatar at the bottom of the sidebar.

## October 15, 2025

  - **Multi-Agent Mode**: Run multiple AI agents from one prompt. This is useful when you want to compare different approaches or if you're not sure if a specific model is the best fit for your task.
    ![Multi-Agent Mode](https://cdn.terragonlabs.com/multi-agent-mode-5K1D.png)
- **Agent Reliability**: We revamped how we dispatch work to agents to make them more reliable. This should help reduce the number of errors related to tasks hanging on the "Waiting for assistant to start" step.
- **Codex Reliability**:
  - We improved how we invoke the Codex agent to make it more reliable for long threads. This should help reduce the number of issues related to long Codex tasks not responding past a certain point.
  - We changed how we handle ChatGPT subscriptions to make them more reliable and reduce the number of errors related to authentication failures when using the Codex agent.

**UX Improvements & Bug Fixes**

- Agent failures are now accompanied by any stderr output from the agent to make it easier to understand what went wrong.
- Devices now stay awake during audio recording to prevent them from going to sleep and interrupting the recording.

#### Task Information

Each task displays: [`Task status`](/tasks/managing-tasks#task-status), an automatically generated title based on your original prompt, when the task was created, repository and branch information, [`PR status`](/tasks/managing-tasks#pr-status) (if applicable), [`CI status`](/tasks/managing-tasks#ci-status) (if applicable), lines of code changed (if applicable), and the agent icon (for running tasks).

### Task Status

Tasks display visual indicators on the left showing their current state.

| Icon                                                                                                                        | Status   | Description                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| <div className="inline-flex items-center justify-center w-3 h-3"><div className="w-1 h-1 rounded-full bg-blue-500" /></div> | Unread   | Task updated, but not been viewed yet |
| <Clock className="inline w-3 h-3 text-yellow-600/90" strokeWidth={3} />                                                     | Pending  | Task is queued or waiting for sandbox |
| <CircleDashed className="inline w-3 h-3 text-muted-foreground animate-[spin_1.5s_linear_infinite]" strokeWidth={2} />       | Running  | Task is actively being worked on      |
| <Check className="inline w-3 h-3 text-green-600/90" strokeWidth={3} />                                                      | Complete | Task completed successfully           |
| <X className="inline w-3 h-3 text-red-600/90" strokeWidth={3} />                                                            | Error    | Task encountered an error             |

### PR Status

Once a task completes successfully, an icon will appear to the right indicating its PR's state.

| Icon                                                               | Status | Description                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| <GitPullRequestDraft className="inline w-4 h-4 text-[#656c76]" />  | Draft  | PR created as draft `default`           |
| <GitPullRequestArrow className="inline w-4 h-4 text-[#238636]" />  | Open   | PR is open and ready for review         |
| <GitMerge className="inline w-4 h-4 text-[#8957e5]" />             | Merged | PR has been merged into the base branch |
| <GitPullRequestClosed className="inline w-4 h-4 text-[#da3633]" /> | Closed | PR was closed without merging           |

### CI Status

When a PR is open, you can monitor your continuous integration checks directly from Terragon next to the PR status.

| Icon                                                                                                                | Status  | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon-pending.png" alt="Pending" className="inline w-4 h-4" /> | Pending | CI checks are currently running        |
| <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon-success.png" alt="Success" className="inline w-4 h-4" /> | Success | All CI checks have passed successfully |
| <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon-failure.png" alt="Failure" className="inline w-4 h-4" /> | Failure | One or more CI checks have failed      |

### Run Correlation and Ready Guard

Task execution now enforces run correlation and deterministic ready transitions:

- `runId` is the canonical identity for daemon events, preview sessions, validation attempts, and ready checks.
- Daemon envelope v2 carries `payloadVersion`, `runId`, `eventId`, `seq`, and terminal `endSha`.
- Duplicate `eventId` and out-of-order `seq` are no-op (`202`) to prevent double-apply mutations.
- Strict mode (`daemonRunIdStrict=true`) quarantines missing/mismatched run envelopes; legacy mode records `legacy_mode` quarantine and marks UI validation outcomes conservatively.
- Terminal events with missing `endSha` are quarantined; stale runs are finalized by maintenance backstop to avoid hanging active runs.
- All PR-ready transitions are wrapped by the shared UI ready guard so new entry points fail closed until explicitly wrapped.

<Callout type="info" title="Retention and Debugging">
  Quarantine rows are retained for 30 days. Oversized payloads are stored as R2 pointers to avoid row bloat, with hash + 2KB prefix retained inline for quick triage.

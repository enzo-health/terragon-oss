import { Tabs, Tab } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";
import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";
import { House, Paperclip, Mic } from "lucide-react";

### Starting a New Task

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click on [<House className="inline-block w-4 h-4 mx-1" /> **Home**](https://www.terragonlabs.com) from the sidebar
  </Step>
  <Step>Select your repository, your branch and model near the prompt box</Step>
  <Step>Write in your prompt and include any context</Step>
  <Step>Submit</Step>
</Steps>

### Adding Context

<Tabs items={['File References', 'Images & PDFs', 'Voice Input', 'URLs']}>
  <Tab value="File References">
    Reference specific files with `@`:
    <Steps>
      <Step>Type `@` to trigger autocomplete</Step>
      <Step>Start typing the filename</Step>
      <Step>Select from suggestions</Step>
    </Steps>
    ```text
    Refactor the authentication logic in @src/auth/login.ts to match the patterns used in
    @src/auth/register.ts
    ```

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Images & PDFs">
    Attach images, PDFs, and text files:
    <Steps>
      <Step>Click the <Paperclip className="inline-block w-4 h-4 mx-1" /> icon or drag-and-drop</Step>
      <Step>Paste images from clipboard with `CMD + V` / `Ctrl + V`</Step>
      <Step>Supports images (`PNG`, `JPG`, `GIF`, `WebP`, etc.), `PDF`, and text files (`TXT`, `JSON`, etc.) up to 10MB each</Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Voice Input">
    Dictate complex requirements:

    <Steps>
      <Step>Click the <Mic className="inline-block w-4 h-4 mx-1" /> icon</Step>
      <Step>Prompt at the speed of thought</Step>
      <Step>Review and edit the transcription</Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="URLs">
      Include links for additional context:
    ```text
      Fix the bug described in this issue:
      https://github.com/myorg/myapp/issues/234
    ```
    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" title="Best Practices">
  **Write Descriptive Prompts**: The more context you give the AI agent, the better. Meaty task descriptions often require little or no follow-up.

**Think Parallel**: Terragon shines when you split your work between multiple async AI agents—whether it's fixing bugs, starting new features, or doing background research.

**Be Specific**

❌ Fix the bug

✅ Fix the authentication timeout bug where users are logged out after 30 minutes of inactivity. The issue is likely in @src/auth/session.ts where we handle token refresh.

**Provide Context**

❌ Add tests

✅ Add unit tests for the payment processing module in @src/payments/. Cover successful transactions, failed payments, refund processing, and webhook handling. Use existing patterns from @src/payments/stripe.test.ts

**Set Clear Goals**

❌ Improve performance

✅ Optimize dashboard loading time by implementing lazy loading for charts, adding pagination to the activity feed (10 items per page), and using React.memo for expensive components. Target: under 1 second load time.

</Callout>

### Multi-Agent Mode

You can run multiple AI agents from a single prompt to compare different approaches or evaluate which model is best suited for your task:

![Multi-Agent Mode](https://cdn.terragonlabs.com/multi-agent-mode-5K1D.png)

Each selected agent will create a separate task, working independently on your prompt. This is particularly useful when:

- You're exploring different implementation approaches
- You're unsure which model will perform best for your specific task
- You want to compare outputs from different AI agents
- You're prototyping and want to see multiple solutions quickly

### After Submission

Your task will:

<Steps>
  <Step>Provision a development environment</Step>
  <Step>
    Clone the repository, install dependencies and run your setup script
  </Step>
  <Step>Execute the requested changes</Step>
  <Step>Run tests if specified</Step>
  <Step>Create a pull request when complete</Step>
</Steps>

### Preview Validation Runs (Internal)

Terragon now treats every execution as a canonical `runId`.

- `thread_run` stores immutable run facts (start request, frozen flags, SHAs, terminal metadata).
- `thread_run_context` stores only the active pointer for `{threadId,threadChatId}`.
- Propagation path is explicit: `startAgentMessage` -> daemon start payload -> daemon envelope v2 -> `/api/daemon-event`.

When preview is enabled, session startup is API-only (`/api/internal/preview/*`, `/api/preview/*`) and follows:

`pending -> initializing -> ready | unsupported | error`

Preview routes are gated by `sandboxPreview`; disabled environments return `404` instead of partial behavior.
